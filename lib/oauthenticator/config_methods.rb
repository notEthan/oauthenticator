module OAuthenticator
  # This module contains stubs, or in some cases default values, for implementations of particulars of the 
  # OAuth protocol. Applications must implement some of these, and are likely to want to override the default 
  # values of others. certain methods will need to use methods of the {OAuthenticator::SignedRequest} class.
  #
  # the methods your implementation will need to be used are primarily those from the parsed OAuth 
  # Authorization header. these are methods your implementation WILL need to use to implement the required 
  # functionality:
  #
  # - `#consumer_key`
  # - `#token`
  # - `#nonce`
  # - `#timestamp`
  #
  # the following are the other parts of the Authorization, but your implementation will probably NOT need to 
  # use these (OAuthenticator does everything that is needed to validate these parts):
  #
  # - `#version`
  # - `#signature_method`
  # - `#signature`

    # method may remain unimplemented.
